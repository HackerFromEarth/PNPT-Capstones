## Objective

The capstone boxes aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and performing cyber attacks. The primary focus was to safely simulate real-world cyberattacks on systems, networks, or applications in order to: mimic real-world attack scenarios, develope an adversary mindset, and also keep my learning in mind for my day job for detecting and analyzing security alerts as a SOC Analyst. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of a hacker mindset, attack processes, and offensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of attack concepts and practical application.
- Information gathering and enumeration by scanning networks and enumerating services.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
