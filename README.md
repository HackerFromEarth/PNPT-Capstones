## Objective

These capstone boxes aim to establish a controlled environment for simulating and performing cyber attacks. The primary focuses were to safely simulate real-world cyberattacks on systems, networks, or applications in order to: mimic real-world attack scenarios, develope an adversary mindset, and also help in my day job for detecting and analyzing security alerts as a SOC Analyst. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of a hacker mindset, attack processes, and offensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of attack concepts and practical application.
- Information gathering and enumeration by scanning networks and enumerating services.
- Offensive security techniques (exploiting vulnerabilities, tools used, techniques).
- Gaining familiarity with post-compromise techniques.
- Correlating simulated attack behavior with real-world alerts I see at work.

### Tools Used

- Nmap - Tool used to gather information about hosts, services, and operating systems on a network. 
- Metasploit - Penetration testing framework that helps security professionals identify and exploit vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications.
- Github tools to create realistic exploitation and attack scenarios.
- Hashcat - Password cracking tool
- Fuff - Fast web fuzzer that allows directory discovery.
- BurpSuite - Web application security testing software suite used for penetration testing.
- Netcat - Networking utility used for establishing connections, reading and writing data over TCP and UDP protocols (used it for transferring files/backdoor).
